## Machine Learning
[A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)

### Representation
- LR vs SVM vs decision tree vs dnn
- assumption
- overfitting vs underfitting
- bias vs variance

### Evaluation
- loss

### Optimization

- first-order optimization or second-order optimization algorithm
- optimization strategy, sgd, momentum, rmsprop, adam, adamw

## Deep Learning

### General
- difference between all kinds of norm
- bn vs se
- alpha in bn, how to prune network using alpha
- bn vs whitening
- eps and momentum in bn
- loss normalization: use batch-wise norm vs sample-wise norm
- interpreting confidence scores: process each class separately or not
- the use of activation function
- relu vs sigmoid
- backpropagation
- class imbalance

### Convolutional neural networks
- assumption of convolutional neural network
- why convolutional layer not fc layer
- features fusion methods
- dilated conv vs deconvolution
- receptive field calculation
- why we don't need bias in conv when networks are pluged in bn
- backpropagation of pooling layer and bn

### Object detection 
- one stage vs two stage
- ssd vs yolo vs retinanet
- roi align vs roi pooling
- anchor matching strategy
- positive, negative, ignore anchor
- objective function
- how to detect small objects
- how to get better detection performance
- how to get faster detection model
- why multi-scale and how
- data augmentation
- train from scratch
- freeze part of layers or not
- the difference between face detection and pedestrain detection

# Program basics
- leetcode
- copy vs deepcopy in python

# Linux basics
- command
- tool chain, include, library, environment variable
